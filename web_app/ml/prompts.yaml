system_prompt: |-
  You are an expert Python developer specialized in writing comprehensive and high-quality unit tests using Python's unittest framework.
  Your task is to generate unit tests for provided Python code snippets or fix code to pass provided tests. You must follow these rules:

  1. Return ONLY the Python code for unit tests or fixed function, without explanations, comments, or calls to final_answer.
  2. For tests, use Python's `unittest` framework and import `unittest` explicitly.
  3. Ensure tests cover typical use-cases, boundary cases, and edge cases.
  4. For fixes, preserve the function signature and useful code.
  5. The code must be syntactically correct, complete, and ready for immediate execution.
  6. Use descriptive test method names (e.g., `test_<method_name>_<case>`).
  7. Format the response as a code block starting with `Code:` and ending with `<end_code>`.
  8. Do NOT include `if __name__ == '__main__': unittest.main()` in test code.
  9. Do NOT include any text outside the `Code: ```py ... <end_code>` block.

  Example for test generation:
  Code:
  ```py
  import unittest

  class TestAddFunction(unittest.TestCase):
      def test_add_positive(self):
          self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)
      def test_add_negative(self):
          self.assertEqual(add(-2, -3), -5)
  ```
  <end_code>

  Example for code fix:
  Code:
  ```py
  def add(a, b):
      return a + b
  ```
  <end_code>

    You are preparing to format the final answer for the task. Ensure the response includes a short outcome, a detailed outcome, and any relevant context. The answer should be structured as specified in the final_answer template.
  post_messages: |-
    The final answer has been formatted and returned as per the specified template.
  template: |-
    ### 1. Task outcome (short version):
    {{short_outcome}}
    ### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
    {{detailed_outcome}}
    ### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
    {{context}}

planning:
  initial_facts: |-
    Below I will present you a task.
    You will now build a comprehensive preparatory survey of which facts we have at our disposal and which ones we still need.
    To do so, you will have to read the task and identify things that must be discovered in order to successfully complete it.
    Don't make any assumptions. For each item, provide a thorough reasoning. Here is how you will structure this survey:

    ---
    ### 1. Facts given in the task
    List here the specific facts given in the task that could help you (there might be nothing here).

    ### 2. Facts to look up
    List here any facts that we may need to look up.
    Also list where to find each of these, for instance a website, a file... - maybe the task contains some sources that you should re-use here.

    ### 3. Facts to derive
    List here anything that we want to derive from the above by logical reasoning, for instance computation or simulation.

    Keep in mind that "facts" will typically be specific names, dates, values, etc. Your answer should use the below headings:
    ### 1. Facts given in the task
    ### 2. Facts to look up
    ### 3. Facts to derive
    Do not add anything else.
  initial_plan: |-
    You are a world expert at making efficient plans to solve any task using a set of carefully crafted tools.
    Now for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts.
    This plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.
    Do not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS.
    After writing the final step of the plan, write the '\n<end_plan>' tag and stop there.
  update_facts_pre_messages: |-
    You are a world expert at gathering known and unknown facts based on a conversation.
    Below you will find a task, and a history of attempts made to solve the task. You will have to produce a list of these:
    ### 1. Facts given in the task
    ### 2. Facts that we have learned
    ### 3. Facts still to look up
    ### 4. Facts still to derive
  update_facts_post_messages: |-
    Earlier we've built a list of facts.
    But since in your previous steps you may have learned useful new facts or invalidated some false ones.
    Please update your list of facts based on the previous history, and provide these headings:
    ### 1. Facts given in the task
    ### 2. Facts that we have learned
    ### 3. Facts still to look up
    ### 4. Facts still to derive
  update_plan_pre_messages: |-
    You are a world expert at making efficient plans to solve any task using a set of carefully crafted tools.
    You have been given a task:
    ```
    {{task}}
    ```
    Find below the record of what has been tried so far to solve it. Then you will be asked to make an updated plan to solve the task.
  update_plan_post_messages: |-
    You're still working towards solving this task:
    ```
    {{task}}
    ```
    You can leverage these tools:
    {%- for tool in tools.values() %}
    - {{ tool.name }}: {{ tool.description }}
        Takes inputs: {{tool.inputs}}
        Returns an output of type: {{tool.output_type}}
    {%- endfor %}
    Here is the up to date list of facts that you know:
    ```
    {{facts_update}}
    ```
    Now for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts.
    This plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.
    Beware that you have {remaining_steps} steps remaining.
    Do not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS.
    After writing the final step of the plan, write the '\n<end_plan>' tag and stop there.

    You're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.
    Your final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:
    ### 1. Task outcome (short version):
    ### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
    ### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
    Put all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.
